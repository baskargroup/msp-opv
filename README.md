# msp-opv
A data-driven study for Material–Structure–Property (MSP) mapping in organic photovoltaics. The repository includes a 25k-sample physics-informed dataset, a compact feature set that links material parameters with microstructure descriptors, and a random-forest surrogate model for predicting short-circuit current.
